If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126. BASH_EXECUTION_STRING Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary. The killed text is saved on the kill-ring. Move forward to the end of the next word. Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits). -v Print shell input lines as they are read. If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.
