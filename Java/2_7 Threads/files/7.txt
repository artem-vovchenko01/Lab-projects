A compound command is one of the following. In most cases a list in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through the history as necessary. This is an incremental search. \UHHHHHHHH The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits [-+]O [shopt_option] cdspell If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected.

If the first argument is exactly ( and the third argument is exactly ), the result is the one-argument test of the second argument. Other‐ Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted. When a process is stopped, the shell imme‐ tern begins with #, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of parameter. If pattern begins with %, it must match at the end of the expanded value of one that exists and is readable.

If the program is a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program. The shell executes the specified interpreter on oper‐ 2. If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command is skipped and not executed. When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see COMMAND EXECUTION above), rbash turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script. as a line continuation. The expression is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially.
