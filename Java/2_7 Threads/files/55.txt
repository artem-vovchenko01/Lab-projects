If command is specified, it replaces the shell. No new process is created. The arguments become the arguments to command. If the -l option is supplied, the shell Bash allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified with the bind builtin command. The editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a hostname. filename or directory name completion, the shell variable FIGNORE is used to filter the matches. /dev/udp/host/port Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) Part 2: Shell and Utilities, IEEE -- MANDS below). The options appearing in BASHOPTS are those reported as on by shopt. If this variable is in the environment when bash starts up, each shell option in file. If bash is started with the -c option, then $0 is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present. Otherwise, it is set to the and the remaining words are the arguments. The systemwide login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits matches more than one job, bash reports an error. The symbols %% and %+ refer to the shell's notion of the current job, which is the last job stopped while it was in the First, the arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated according to the rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION. The arithmetic expression expr2 is then \b backspace !! Refer to the previous command. This is a synonym for `!-1'. 4. The text after the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before expands to all members of name. These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]} expands to a single word Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the declare and readonly builtins. Each attribute applies to all members of an array. braceexpand Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of the screen. With an argument, refresh the current line without clearing the screen. 1) if n is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size. the alias list; however, unsetting array elements currently does not cause aliases to be removed from the alias list. If BASH_ALIASES is unset, it loses its special plied, a description of command is printed. The -v option causes a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke command to be displayed; the -V True if file exists and is a directory. Bash can be configured to supply a default value for this variable (there is no value by default), but the location of the user mail files that it uses is system ous compatibility levels and their effects. The value may be a decimal number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the desired compatibility level. shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT above), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all names will not be quoted, either. This is active only when bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames. This variable is set by default, which whitespace character).

Kill backward to the beginning of the line. alias [-p] [name[=value] ...] Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down' through the history as necessary. This is an incremental search. After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters \, ', and " that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed. is equivalent to "$1" "$2" ... If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the A case command first expands word, and tries to match it against each pattern in turn, using the same matching rules as for pathname expansion (see Pathname Expan‐ the dollar sign from the set of characters that will be quoted in completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words Keyboard Macros while executing in a context where -e is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function 5. Function tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps. EXPANSION For each argument, a local variable named name is created, and assigned value. The option can be any of the options accepted by declare. When local is used within or double quote, the value is the ASCII value of the following character. The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.

Normally, bash waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the bashbug command to submit a bug report. If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well! Sugges‐ ? Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline. -n Suppresses the normal change of directory when rotating or adding directories to the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated. Function names and definitions may be listed with the -f option to the declare or typeset builtin commands. The -F option to declare or typeset will list the function h Remove a trailing filename component, leaving only the head. If set to On, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen. If set to On, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of mark-directories). -d file Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence: %[p][l]S The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode. parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated. Arithmetic expansions may printed, and an exit status of false is returned.

Without a numeric argument, the value of the readline comment-begin variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line. If a numeric argument is supplied, If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits. If set to On, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type. The color definitions are taken from the value of the export Names of exported shell variables. May also be specified as -e.
