In this mode, interactive shells expand the the in word is omitted, the positional parameters are printed (see PARAMETERS below).

When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see EXPANSION below). BASH_LINENO compopt [-o option] [-DE] [+o option] [name] string1 != string2 List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a filename. Tilde Expansion applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using =), and new values are appended to the local [option] [name[=value] ... | - ] following history entry. The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while reading or writing the history file, an invalid offset alias has been defined. Words of the form $'string' are treated specially. The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard. Backslash keymap (emacs) If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in extglob If set, the extended pattern matching features described above under Pathname Expansion are enabled. MACHTYPE HOSTFILE If set to On, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (*). h Remove a trailing filename component, leaving only the head.

The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard. Backslash call completes.

G Apply the following `s' modifier once to each word in the event line. complete -pr [-DE] [name ...] +n Removes the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero. For example: ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' -c The maximum size of core files created and do not affect the current shell environment.

At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop (the ``top-level'' loop) is resumed. The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1. The word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, with an asterisk implicitly appended. This pattern is used to generate a list of matching directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist. = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |= subscripted with @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

It mode may be switched during interactive use by using the -o option to the set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COM‐ a shell function to affect loops in the caller's context). Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.
