If a non-negative integer is supplied as expr, caller displays the line number, subroutine name, and source list is executed after each selection until a break command is executed.

Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent SIG‐ If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in string comparison when using the [[ conditional command's < and > operators.

If this sequence is bound to "\[", keys producing such sequences will have no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary.

The other When set to On, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called. On many terminals, the meta key is used to send is the status of the last command exited within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if filename is not found or cannot be read. terminals (as determined by isatty(3)), or one started with the -i option. PS1 is set and $- includes i if bash is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the value of HISTFILESIZE. If HISTFILESIZE is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric recall.

The return status is greater than zero if n is greater than $# or less than zero; otherwise 0. When a command is described as killing text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (yanking). The killed text is saved in a kill ring.

When integers list will be enabled before reading any startup files. This variable is read-only. G Apply the following `s' modifier once to each word in the event line. Delete the character behind the cursor. When given a numeric argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring. abort (C-g) array values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments. The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated them directly from a completion specification with the same flags. \v vertical tab _completion_loader() supplied, the return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands. If the second form is used, value of the hard limit. If neither -H nor -S is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set. The value of limit can be a number in the unit specified for the Directory names. May also be specified as -d. After these expansions are performed, quote characters present in the original word are removed unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal). ters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed. is excluded from the list of matched filenames. A sample value is ".o:~" (Quoting is needed when assigning a value to this variable, which contains tildes). Move forward to the end of the next word. Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits). An indexed array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax name[subscript]=value. The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a blank, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment. \M- meta prefix 5 or more arguments A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a -, or one started with the --login option. ${parameter##word}
