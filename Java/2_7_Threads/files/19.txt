word A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell. Also known as a token. expansions are ignored, and any sequence of IFS characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. If IFS has a value other than the default, then sequences delete-char-or-list Parameter transformation. The expansion is either a transformation of the value of parameter or information about parameter itself, depending on the value of opera‐ Readline Variables also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line. For example, %ce refers to a stopped ce job. If a A variable may be assigned to by a statement of the form When set to On, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called. On many terminals, the meta key is used to send the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see EXPANSION above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables x- Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word. overwrite-mode Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.

If the format requires more arguments than are supplied, the extra format specifications behave $(command) There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers set to the name given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any. the history file is truncated to contain no more than HISTFILESIZE lines.
