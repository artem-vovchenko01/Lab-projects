If no matching filenames are found, and the interactive_comments There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The character % introduces a job specification (jobspec).

Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment. Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is: shift [n] if no commands were executed.
