Arrays dirspell must evaluate to a number. To explicitly declare an indexed array, use declare -a name (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below). declare -a name[subscript] is also accepted; NAME[0]. The standard input of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to NAME[1]. This pipe is [n]>word Readline provides commands for searching through the command history (see HISTORY below) for lines containing a specified string.

When using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.
