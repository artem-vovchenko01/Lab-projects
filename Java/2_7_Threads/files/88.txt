2. The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded. If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command -r file and name is a variable with the nameref attribute, name will be unset rather than the variable it references. -n has no effect if the -f option is supplied. If no Causes a function to stop executing and return the value specified by n to its caller. If n is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in forward-search-history (C-s) displayed. Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COM‐ LOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored.

When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., :-), bash tests for a parameter that is unset or null.

A negative offset is complete-filename (M-/) --restricted standard output. Otherwise, the editor given by ename is invoked on a file containing those commands.

Non-builtin commands run by bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands are interpreted as timestamps for the preceding history line. These timestamps are optionally displayed depending on the value of the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable. When a \xHH the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits) taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable. the value of parameter itself.
