# Algorithms Part 1 Princeton university

This directory contains code with algorithms for [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course on Coursera.
It includes implementations of these algorithms:

* Dijkstra algorithm for expression evaluation
* sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, shellsort, mergesort, bottom-up mergesort, different variants of quicksort, heapsort)

Data structures:
* binary heap
* union find (disjoint set)
* symbol table using binary tree
* queues (using arrays and linked lists)
* deque
* randomized queue
* stacks (using arrays and linked lists)

Projects:
* Percolation. This project uses union find data structure
* Collinear points finder
* 8Puzzle. Solver for 8Puzzle game usiing A* algorithm 
and others.
